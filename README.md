# BikeCounting
The repository is to organize bike counting related datasets (bike counts, bike shares, bikes on buses, bike facilities and infrastructure, etc.) collected in CLMPO.

# Bike counts

Bicycle counts in Central Lane MPO area combine both permanent and short-term tube counts. There are 16 permanent counters that are collecting data continuously and data is accessible from [Eco-Visio](https://www.eco-visio.net/v5/login/?callback=%2Fv5%2F#::) with credentials. Six [short-term bike counting tubes](https://www.eco-counter.com/produits/pyro-evo-range-en/urban-postevo/) are rotated manually every two weeks from March to October among the locations determined by a process described in the Section 2 Data Collection (page 19) in [the ODOT bicycle count data report](https://www.oregon.gov/odot/Programs/ResearchDocuments/304-761%20Bicycle%20Counts%20Travel%20Safety%20Health.pdf#page=24). The CLMPO bike counts can be viewed and downloaded from the [data portal](https://www.lcog.org/thempo/page/bicycle-counts). The data includes various spatial and temporal information about bike counts with
